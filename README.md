## Project Objectives

Customer churn, the loss of customers to competitors or service discontinuation, is a critical challenge in the telecom industry, costing millions in revenue annually. My objective was to create a robust, data-driven tool to:
- Analyze customer behavior across demographics, services, and billing to identify churn drivers.
- Develop predictive models to forecast at-risk customers, enabling proactive retention.
- Present insights through interactive, user-friendly visualizations accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- Build a scalable, cloud-hosted web application to support strategic decision-making.
- Demonstrate my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, web development, and business intelligence for my portfolio.

This project reflects my ability to address complex business problems with technical innovation, aligning with my career goal of excelling as a Data Analyst and Developer.

## Technical Scope and Contributions

As the sole developer, I managed all phases of the project, from data processing to deployment, showcasing a comprehensive skill set. Below are my key contributions, organized by project component:

### 1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**
- **Dataset**: Processed a telecom dataset (`customer_churn_data.csv`) with 21 columns, including customerID, tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and churn status.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values by imputing categorical data with mode and numerical TotalCharges with median.
  - Converted invalid TotalCharges entries (e.g., empty strings) to median values using Pandas.
  - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, contract) with Scikit-learn’s LabelEncoder for modeling.
- **Insights Derived**:
  - Identified a 26% overall churn rate, highlighting the urgency of retention efforts.
  - Found month-to-month contracts had a 40% churn rate, compared to 5% for two-year contracts.
  - Noted 30% churn among fiber optic internet users, suggesting cost or service quality issues.
  - Observed higher churn risk for customers with <12 months tenure and >$70 monthly charges.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Impact**: My rigorous data analysis provided actionable insights, demonstrating my proficiency in data manipulation and statistical analysis, critical for data analyst roles.

### 2. **Predictive Modeling**
- **Model Development**:
  - Implemented **RandomForestClassifier** (80% accuracy) with tunable parameters (e.g., 100-500 trees, max depth 5-20) using Scikit-learn.
  - Developed **LogisticRegression** (78% accuracy) as a simpler, faster alternative for smaller datasets.
  - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **Feature Importance**: Identified tenure, contract type, and monthly charges as top predictors via RandomForest’s feature importance scores.
- **Prediction Interface**: Built a Streamlit form to input customer details (e.g., tenure, contract, charges) and predict churn probability (e.g., 78% for a high-risk profile).
- **Challenges Overcome**: Tuned hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and ensured robust handling of categorical data imbalances.
- **Tools Used**: Scikit-learn, Python, NumPy.
- **Impact**: My predictive analytics enabled proactive retention strategies, showcasing my machine learning expertise and ability to deliver high-accuracy models.

### 3. **Web Application Development**
- **Framework**: Utilized Streamlit to create a responsive, browser-based dashboard with sidebar navigation.
- **Features**:
  - **Interactive Dashboard**: Designed filters for gender, contract type, and tenure range to segment data dynamically.
  - **Visualizations**: Created pie charts (churn distribution), scatter plots (tenure vs. charges), histograms (numerical features by churn), and bar charts (categorical vs. churn) using Plotly.
  - **Predefined Filters**: Added “High-Risk Customers” and “Senior Citizens” filters to simplify analysis.
  - **Export Functionality**: Enabled CSV downloads of filtered data and text-based analysis reports.
  - **EDA Section**: Included correlation heatmaps and feature-wise churn analysis for deeper insights.
- **UI/UX Design**:
  - Applied custom CSS for a professional teal-blue gradient theme with Inter font and Font Awesome icons.
  - Ensured responsive design for desktop and mobile compatibility.
  - Added a branded footer: “© 2025 Powered by Felixidowu” with a link to [https://felido01.github.io/felixidowu01/intro.html](https://felido01.github.io/felixidowu01/intro.html).
- **Tools Used**: Streamlit, Plotly, HTML/CSS, Python.
